    <h1>INVESTMENT CALCULATOR</h1>
    <h3>GOAL: A simple investment calculator that takes an initial investment amount in dollars. Then accepts an interest rate between 2-7%. Then takes an additional amount of money for each term of the investment. Enter a investment term(ie. how long). Then specify that the term will be in years or months. Result will be your total interest earned and the total amount in your account.</h3>
