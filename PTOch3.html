        <h2>V3</h2>
    <p>A simple PTO(Paid Time Off) calculator that uses how many years you have worked to get correct PTO rate. Then use how many weeks you have worked so far this year to calculate total PTO to date. Then deduct any PTO that you have taken to date. Results can be returned in hours or days or weeks.</p>
    <!-- 1-4yrs = 5hrs
    equal to or greater than 5yrs = 6hrs
    equal to or greater than 10yrs = 7hrs -->
    <ol>
        <li>DISPLAY "How many years have you worked?"</li>
        <li>INPUT YearsWorked</li>
        <li>If YearsWorked &lt; 5 give PTO value of 5</li>
        <li>If YearsWorked &gt; 5 give PTO value of 6</li>
        <li>If YearsWorked &gt; 10 give PTO value of 7</li>
        <li>TotalChecks = YearsWorked * 26</li>
        <li>FinalPTO = TotalChecks / 40</li>
    </ol>   
    <p>How many years have you worked?</p>
